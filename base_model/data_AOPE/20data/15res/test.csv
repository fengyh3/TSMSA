I O

I O

he O

brought O
us O

did O
not O

wanted O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O

so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

1
Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O

I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O

The O
manager O
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

We O
paid O
and O
left O

we O

even O
more O

it O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O

I O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

1
By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good B

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O

there O
I O
would O

my O

was O
inedible B
! O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant O
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused B

and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O

a O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6:20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O
. O

1
The O
hostess O
said O
`` O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O

I O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O

there O
will O
be O

so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

1
At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

1
The O
â€– [SEP]
menu O
â€– [SEP]
is O
fairly O
simple B
without O
much O
descriptions O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
â€– [SEP]
beer O
â€– [SEP]
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment B
. O

Not O
much B
of O
a O
â€– [SEP]
selection O
of O
bottled O
beer O

either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
â€– [SEP]
fried O
oysters O
and O
clams O
â€– [SEP]
were O
delicious B
but O
a O
tiny B
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

The O
â€– [SEP]
lobster O
knuckles O
â€– [SEP]
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok B
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless B

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
`` O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
( O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
) O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma O

and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

1
We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

1
She O
replied O
`` O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O

since O
you O
are O
a O

it O
might O
get O

called O
the O

was O
very O
close O
by O

she O
told O
us O

so O
we O
did O

The O

okay O

I O
was O

I O

, O
I O
switch O

I O
could O
stomach O
the O

the O
â€– [SEP]

so O

I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

1
I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O

it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O

I O

not O
want O

serve O
us O

The O
only O
thing O
that O

down O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O

the O

looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O

1
I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O

stay O

the O

said O

`` O
can O
I O

`` O
how O

What O
? O

1
The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O

of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O

how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O

unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O

the O
problem O
